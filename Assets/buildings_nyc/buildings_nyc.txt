23 low poly buildings textured.
These buildings are very low polycount (from 18 to 138 triangles) 
using 1024x1024 pixel textures (the buildings are grouped
by material, 3 different sets).

The buildings have two channels unwrapped hand made low seam, the 2nd channel is 
non overlapping 
(for lightmaps).
I recommend not to enable Unity automatic UV generation for lightmaps.

How to use:

Go to prefabs folder and drop the chosen set to your scene.
Buildings are independent but grouped, you can delete or duplicate the buildings from their groups.
The groups are just a gideline for the material sharing.
